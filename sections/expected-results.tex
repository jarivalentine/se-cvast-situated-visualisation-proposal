\section{Expected Results}

The main expected outcome of this project is a state-of-the-art overview of existing approaches to situated visualization presented along a timeline.
A timeline provides both a clear structure and intuitive way to explore shift in terminology.
As Plaisant and Shneiderman (1998) highlight, ``an overview of a personal history is seen in a single screen as a series of timelines.
Users can filter, zoom, highlight, and get details on demand'' \cite{PSM98}, they emphasize the power of timelines to present complex information in a usable way.

To achieve this level of flexibility, a HTML webpage could be implemented.
While the primary outcome of this seminar is the written overview itself, the webpage timeline could be a follow-up step.
A paper is fixed in its discoveries, but a webpage can be updated whenever needed, this would support expanding the overview beyond the paper, both by extending the time span back in time and by documenting new discoveries as they come.

Afterwards, users will be able to explore the overview to help them decide which approaches suit their needs, compare approaches based on ethical considerations and analyze unfamiliar terminology within the context of situated visualization.
