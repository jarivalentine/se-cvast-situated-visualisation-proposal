\section{Method (How?)}

The project will be carried out in two phases.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Information Collection:\\
            The first phase focuses on gathering and organizing information on approaches within the defined time span (2020-2025).
            Relevant papers will be found through academic databases.
            Each approach will be documented with its definition and relevant metadata, which then will be structured chronologically.
            \\\textbf{Methodology:} Literature research\\
      \item Ethical Audit:\\
            In the second phase, the approaches will be examined using an Ethical Matrix framework.
            This helps reflect on ethical concerns, enabling us to identify key insights which can be documented alongside each approach.
            \\\textbf{Methodology:} Ethical audit assessment\\
\end{enumerate}
Throughout these phases, the seminar paper will be developed documenting the findings with clarity and structure.
