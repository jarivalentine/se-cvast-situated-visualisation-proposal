\section{Method (How?)}

The project will be conducted in three phases combining literary research and user-centered design.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data Collection:\\
          The first phase focuses on gathering and organizing information on approaches.
          Relevant papers will be found through academic databases.
          Each approach will be documented with its definition and relevant metadata, which then will be structured chronologically.
          \\\small\textbf{Methodology:} Literary research\\
    \item Development:\\
          The second phase involves designing and developing an accessible HTML webpage that can be accessed online.
          Following a user-centered design process with iterative feedback from potential users.
          \\\small\textbf{Methodology:} User-centered design\\
    \item User testing:\\
          A small user test will be conducted to evaluate the first version's usability.
          Participants will be asked to perform tasks such as identifying suitable approaches, comparing alternatives and discovering unfamiliar terminology using a prepared user test script.
          Finally their feedback will be implemented to the platform.
          \\\small\textbf{Methodology:} User-centered design\\
\end{enumerate}
